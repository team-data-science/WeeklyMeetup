# Folders you should create
You should try to keep the repository as clean as possible.
So, use folders and subfolders to organize your files. These ones I recommend to setup:

## /data
This folder is where you copy your data files e.g .csv or .json

## /sources
Create a sources or code folder where you organize your source code. Subfolders always help. Make it as easy to navigate as possible for the viewer

## /images
A good documentation needs images. Copy them into this folder and then use them in your other .md files.

# Add a .gitignore file
Often times your dev-environment is going to place files and folders into your local folder. You don't want to synchronize them with your git repo. You can select to do that and configure the options whenever you create a repo. Or just google it and put it in the root directory

-> You can delete this file
